# Easy Notes

EasyNotes is an online notes application that I am currently working on, using only Swift/SwiftUI. It has sign in/sign up functionality, each user has their own profile. The difference between this app and any other notes app is that I plan on adding the functionality to share notes with your friends by adding their email to your note. I am using FirebaseAuth for the authentication and for the database I am using Firestore.
